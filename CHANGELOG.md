# Changelog

c3nav does not exactly have a versioning scheme. 

This file aims to give you an idea of what has changed between events where c3nav was used or supported by the
development team. These lists do not aim to be complete but help you get an overview about the most iportant changes
and potential backwards incompatibilities.
